### 📦 <ins>Installation via Repository</ins>

1. In KODI:  
   Go to **System > Settings > File Manager > Left Panel**  
   → Double-click: **Add source**  
   → Double-click: `<None>`  
   → Enter the following URL:  
   **`https://lynxstrike.github.io/lynxstrike.repo/`**  
   → Click **Done**

2. ⚠️ **The URL is _caseSensitive_ — not case-insensitive!**  
   - You must type it exactly as shown: `lynxstrike.repo`  
   - If you type any capital letters (e.g., `LynxStrike`), **KODI will not detect the repo**

3. Name the repository or leave it as KODI parsed it (Recommended)

4. Click **OK**

5. The `lynxstrike.repo` repository will now appear as a **source option** (like SMB, mapped drive, etc.) in the Add-ons browser

6. Go to:  
   **System > Add-ons > Install from repository**  
   → Select **lynxstrike.repo** (or the name you provided)  
   → **Look and Feel > Image Collection**  
   → Click **Studio Icons - Coloured - Modded** to install the addon and its dependencies

7. ✅ Installation complete!  
   KODI will now render any studio image that matches the **Studio Icons - Coloured - Modded** collection
