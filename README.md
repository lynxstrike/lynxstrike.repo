### 📦 <ins>Installation</ins> (2 Options)

You can install Madnox in one of two ways:

1. **Manual ZIP install** (no auto-updates)  
2. **Install via Kittmaster's Repository** (auto-update notifications & installation) **← Recommended**

> 📝 **Note:**  
> Madnox is a retooled derivative of a skin originally intended for the official Kodi repository. Due to life priorities, the original author never submitted it. We aim to meet that original goal by modernizing and maintaining the skin to Kodi’s latest standards.

### 🗂️ <ins>Option 1: Manual ZIP Install</ins> (Legacy Method)

1. Download the latest ZIP from:  
   [📁 Repository ZIPs](https://github.com/kittmaster/KittmasterRepo/tree/master/repo/zips/repository.kittmaster)
2. Click the download icon next to the file (hover left of the pencil icon).
3. In Kodi:  
   Go to **System > Settings > Add-ons > Install from zip file**  
   → Enable **Unknown sources** if prompted  
   → Set **Update official add-ons** to **Any repositories**
4. Browse to the downloaded ZIP and click **OK**.
5. The skin and dependencies will install (may take a few minutes).
6. When prompted, select **Yes** to keep the new skin.

### 🚀 <ins>Option 2: Install via Repository</ins> (Recommended)

1. In Kodi:  
   Go to **System > Settings > File Manager > Left Panel**  
   → Double-click: **Add source**  
   → Double-click: `<None>`  
   → Enter this URL:  
   **`https://kittmaster.github.io/KittmasterRepo/`**  
   → Click **Done**

2. ⚠️ **The URL is _caseSensitive_ — not case-insensitive!**  
   - You must type it exactly as shown: `KittmasterRepo` with capital **K** and **R**  
   - If you type it in lowercase, **Kodi will not detect the repo**

3. Name the repository or leave it as Kodi parsed it (recommended)

4. Click **OK**

5. The Kittmaster Repository will now appear as a **source option** (like SMB, mapped drive, etc.) in the Add-ons browser

6. Go to:  
   **System > Add-ons > Install from repository**  
   → Select **KittmasterRepo** (or the name you provided)  
   → **Look and Feel > Skin**  
   → Click **Madnox** to install the skin and its dependencies

7. When prompted, select **Yes** to keep the new skin

### 🌍 <ins>Translations</ins>

We aim to support as many languages as possible. However, translation is a lower priority while we stabilize the skin for Omega and future Kodi versions. Localization will improve as development progresses.
